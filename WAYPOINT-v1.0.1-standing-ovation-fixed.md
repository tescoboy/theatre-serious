## 📍 **Stable State Achieved: August 2, 2025**

### **🎯 What's Working:**

- ✅ **AllPlaysView is integrated** and working with modern design
- ✅ **Supabase connection is stable** with correct credentials
- ✅ **Vercel deployment is working** with automatic updates

### **🔧 Key Fixes Applied:**

2. **Fixed AddPlayForm rating parsing** - Correctly handles `"standing"` → `"Standing Ovation"` conversion
3. **Added comprehensive debugging** throughout the rating flow
4. **Updated UnratedPlaysView** with debugging to identify remaining issues

### **📊 Current Status:**
